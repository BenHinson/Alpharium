# Alpharium
Windows Application

Account information is saved within the program, hashed, and anything currently works as an email.

Non-functional rightclick options have a "*" at the end of them.

The triangle in the nav window is an in-progress feature that will act as a small desktop version of the program, where a user can select 'panels' and dropdowns.

'Panel View' is also an in-development feature for managing and accessing open panels. Not yet functional.

Alpha Drive, on startup, creates a Folder 'Alpharium' within the users C: drive, files and folders within will display on this page and in the future have access to panels.
